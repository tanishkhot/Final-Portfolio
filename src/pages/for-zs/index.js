          specifically for your team. I believe initiative = leadership. So, to

          you can find exactly what you need to know about me.

        <SectionTitle> Why ZS?</SectionTitle>
        <SectionText>
          I have always thought Engineering is about solving problems. Fro
          getting from point A to point B, to building a bridge, or even
          creating a software solution, Engineering is everywhere. I have always
          wanted to work in a place where I can solve problems, and ZS is the
          perfect place for that. I am particularly drawn to ZS because of its
          focus on data-driven decision-making.
